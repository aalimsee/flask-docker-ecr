3.3 Introduction to Containerisation

# Steps
1. Create a Public Repository in GitHub
2. Commit Your Flask App
    - app.py
    - requirements.txt
    - Dockerfile
3. Push your code to GitHub
4. Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow
    - .github/workflows
        - docker-build.yaml

# Key Points
- This workflow triggers on any push to the main branch.
- It uses GitHub Secrets for DockerHub credentials. You need to add your DockerHub username and password to GitHub Secrets (explained below).
- It builds and pushes your Docker image to your DockerHub registry.

Add GitHub Secrets for DockerHub Credentials:
- Go to your GitHub repository.
- Navigate to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions.
- Click New repository secret.
- Add the following secrets:
    - DOCKER_USERNAME: Your DockerHub username.
    - DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your DockerHub password or personal access token.

# use the GitHub CLI (gh) to add secrets to your repository
gh secret set DOCKER_USERNAME --repo <your-username>/<your-repo> --body "<your-dockerhub-username>"
gh secret set DOCKER_PASSWORD --repo <your-username>/<your-repo> --body "<your-dockerhub-password-or-access-token>"


# Testing
To test your GitHub Actions workflow for building and pushing the Docker image to DockerHub, follow these steps:

1. Verify Your Repository and Files
Make sure the following files are correctly committed and pushed to your GitHub repository:

app.py (Flask application)

requirements.txt (Python dependencies)

Dockerfile (for creating the Docker image)

.github/workflows/docker-build.yml (GitHub Actions workflow)

2. Push Code to Trigger the Workflow
Make a change in any of your files (like updating the app.py or adding comments), or you can simply commit an empty change (e.g., a minor tweak in the README.md).

After making the change, run the following commands to commit and push to the main branch:

```git add .
git commit -m "Trigger build and push workflow"
git push origin main
```
3. Check GitHub Actions
Go to your GitHub repository.

Click on the "Actions" tab at the top.

You should see your workflow run under the "Docker Build and Push" name.

Click on the latest workflow run to see the progress and details of the build and push process.

If everything is set up correctly, the GitHub Actions log will show steps like:

Checking out the code.

Logging into DockerHub.

Setting up Docker Buildx.

Building and pushing the Docker image to your DockerHub account.

4. Verify on DockerHub
After the workflow completes successfully, go to your DockerHub account:

Log in to DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/.

Check the Repositories section.

You should see the flask-docker-app repository with the latest tag (e.g., latest).

You can also pull the image and run it locally to verify that the Docker image works correctly:

```
docker pull yourdockerhubusername/flask-docker-app:latest

# Map port 5000 inside the container to, say, port 8080 on your Mac
docker run -p 8080:5000 yourdockerhubusername/flask-docker-app:latest
```
This should start your Flask app on port 5000 locally.

5. Troubleshooting
If the workflow fails:

Go to the Actions tab and click on the failed workflow to see the logs.

The logs will show which step failed (e.g., docker/login-action or docker/build-push-action).

Ensure your DockerHub credentials are correctly set in GitHub Secrets (DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD).

Ensure the Dockerfile, app.py, and requirements.txt are valid.

# Docker pull for Mac
```- name: Build and push Docker image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
  with:
    context: .
    push: true
    platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64 # <<< include for MacOS>>>
    tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/flask-docker-app:latest
```


# why 8080:5000?
The -p flag in Docker maps host ports to container ports using the syntax:

-p <host-port>:<container-port>

üîç So in -p 8080:5000:
5000 is the port your Flask app is listening on inside the container (because Flask by default runs on port 5000).

8080 is the port you‚Äôre exposing on your local machine (Mac) so you can access it in your browser via http://localhost:8080.

# üí° Why not 5000:5000?
You can do that:

docker run -p 5000:5000 aalimsee/flask-docker-app:latest

But if something on your Mac is already using port 5000 (like another Flask app), you'll get a ‚Äúport already in use‚Äù error. So:

‚úÖ 5000:5000 is clean if port 5000 is free
‚úÖ 8080:5000 avoids conflict by mapping container port 5000 to a different host port (8080)

# CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
Here's an explanation of:

    CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
    This line is in your Dockerfile and it's responsible for telling Docker how to start your application once the container is created.
    
    üîç Breakdown of CMD:
    In Dockerfiles, CMD defines the default command to run when the container starts.
    
    ‚úÖ 1. flask
    This is the Flask command-line interface (CLI). The flask command helps run and manage your Flask application. When you use flask run, it starts the development server for your app.
    
    The flask CLI is available because Flask is installed in the container‚Äôs environment (via pip in your requirements.txt).
    
    ‚úÖ 2. run
    This is a subcommand to the flask CLI. It starts the Flask development server.
    
    flask run

    By default, the server listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) and port 5000.
    
    ‚úÖ 3. --host=0.0.0.0
    This tells Flask to listen on all available network interfaces instead of just 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
    
    127.0.0.1: Only allows connections from inside the container (i.e., localhost).
    
    0.0.0.0: Makes your app accessible to the outside world, including your local machine and any external requests (like from Docker).
    
    This is especially important in Docker because if Flask only listens on 127.0.0.1, your Mac won‚Äôt be able to connect to the app running inside the container. Using 0.0.0.0 ensures your Flask app is reachable when running inside Docker.
